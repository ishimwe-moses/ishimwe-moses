                <h3>Welcome to Oceania</h3>
                <p>Oceania is a region filled with thousands of islands spread across the central and South Pacific Ocean. It is divided into four main areas: Australasia, Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia. Each area has its own unique cultures, languages, and landscapes, from the bustling cities of Australia to the remote beaches of Micronesia.</p>

                <h3>Regions of Oceania</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Australasia</strong>: Includes Australia and New Zealand, known for their diverse wildlife and modern cities.</li>
                    <li><strong>Melanesia</strong>: Features countries like Fiji and Papua New Guinea, with rich cultural traditions and tropical islands.</li>
