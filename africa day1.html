                    <h2>Day 1: Introduction to Africa</h2>
                    <p>Africa is big and beautiful. It is the second-largest continent on Earth, covering about 30.3 million square kilometers. Africa has many different landscapes, like deserts, rainforests, savannas, and mountains.</p>
                    <p>The Sahara Desert is the world's largest hot desert, and the Congo Rainforest is the second-largest tropical rainforest.</p>
                    <h3>People and Languages</h3>
                    <p>Africa is home to over 1.3 billion people who speak more than 2,000 languages. This makes Africa a very diverse place with many different cultures, music, art, and traditions.</p>
                    <h3>Old Man "Lucy"</h3>
                    <p>A long time ago, scientists found the bones of a very old man named "Lucy" in East Africa. This shows that Africa is the place where humans first lived.</p>
                    <h3>Treasures of the Earth</h3>
                    <p>Africa has many natural treasures, like gold, diamonds, oil, and gas. These resources help many African countries grow and develop.</p>
                    <h3>Challenges and Hopes</h3>
                    <p>Africa faces some challenges like poverty, political instability, and health issues like malaria and HIV/AIDS. But many African countries are also growing fast and making progress in education and healthcare.</p>
                    <h3>Slavery</h3>
                    <p>A long time ago, many Africans were taken away from their homes and sold as slaves. This was a very sad and difficult time in Africa's history. But today, Africa is moving forward with hope and strength.</p>
